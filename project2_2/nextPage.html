			<strong>How I met him: </strong> <br />
			When I was in elementary school, there was a hardcover copy of The Three Musketeers on the bookcase at the back of our classroom. That was my first encounter with Dumas' novel. When I was a kid, I couldn't read the story, but I picked up this book again after I was in high school and was amazed at how interesting the story was and how well it was worded.

			<strong>How I met him: </strong> <br />
			I found a book in a bookstore more than ten years ago with a very interesting title, "The Earth of Man". I didn't like to read famous books at the time, and this book was even more boring to read. One night later, when I picked it up again at school, I was attracted by the faint sadness hidden in it, and I will never forget it.

			His articles appeared in my middle school and high school textbooks. He was a writer during the Chinese Revolution in the early 20th century, and he wrote many articles critically and questioning the society at that time. Many people hated his articles at first because they were confusing and strange. But after reading it carefully, you will be shocked by his other thoughts of compassion and compassion.
